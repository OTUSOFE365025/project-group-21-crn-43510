## Quality Scenarios (ADD Format)

The following scenarios specify measurable conditions and expected responses, following the **Attribute-Driven Design (ADD)** approach.

### **1. Performance and Latency**
**Scenario:**  
*When* a student submits a query during normal operating conditions,  
*the system* must process and return a response within **2 seconds on average**,  
*so that* the user experience remains efficient and responsive.  

**Response Measure:** Average query latency ≤ **2 seconds** under normal load.  
**Rationale:** Ensures smooth, real-time conversational performance.

---

### **2. Availability and Reliability**
**Scenario:**  
*When* the system experiences component failure or downtime,  
*it* must automatically trigger **fail-over** and **recovery** mechanisms,  
*so that* service continuity is maintained with minimal disruption.  

**Response Measure:** Service restored within **30 seconds**, maintaining **99.5% uptime** monthly.  
**Rationale:** Guarantees dependable access for students and faculty.

---

### **3. Security and Access Control**
**Scenario:**  
*When* a user attempts to log in,  
*the system* must authenticate via the institution’s **single sign-on (SSO)** and enforce **role-based access controls**,  
*so that* only authorized users can access or modify data.  

**Response Measure:** 100% of authentication requests validated through SSO; unauthorized access denied.  
**Rationale:** Protects academic and personal data integrity.

---

### **4. Usability and Accessibility**
**Scenario:**  
*When* a student interacts with AIDAP through **text or voice input** on any supported device,  
*the system* must process both input types accurately and display responses through an intuitive conversational interface,  
*so that* it remains accessible across platforms.  

**Response Measure:** 95% of users can complete a standard query task within **three interactions**.  
**Rationale:** Promotes accessibility and user satisfaction.

---

### **5. Maintainability and Monitoring**
**Scenario:**  
*When* performance or error metrics are generated,  
*the platform* must log these events to a centralized **monitoring dashboard**,  
*so that* administrators can detect and resolve issues promptly.  

**Response Measure:** All system components report metrics every **60 seconds**; alerts raised within **5 minutes** of issue detection.  
**Rationale:** Enables proactive maintenance and rapid troubleshooting.
