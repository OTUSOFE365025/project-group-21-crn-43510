Business Case:

Through establishing an intelligent, conversational interface that connects current systems like the LMS, registration, calendar, and email, the AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) seeks to make it easier for university stakeholders to interact with institutional data. In order to locate information, instructors, administrators, and students currently have to use several separate platforms, which causes delays and inefficiencies. In order to solve this issue, AIDAP provides a centralised, cloud-based solution that allows text and voice enquiries, uses artificial intelligence to provide tailored responses, and ensures safe access via the institution's single sign-on (SSO). Offering quicker information retrieval, scheduled reminders, and statistical analysis in real time, this software will enhance ease of use, minimise the workload of administrators, and improve satisfaction among users.
